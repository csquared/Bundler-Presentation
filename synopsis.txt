Bundler: The Easy, The Hard, and the NP-Complete.

Bundler manages an application's dependencies through its entire life across many machines systematically and repeatably. 
This library, written by carlhuda, has become a requirement of Rails 3 to manage gem dependencies and is
rapidly becomming the de-facto standard for gem management in the Ruby world.
In other words, if you're doing Ruby work you're going to be using the Bundler.
This talk's goal is to educate you not only how to use the Bundler, but on how and why it works.
We're going to take a look at the easy stuff: using Bundler to manage your gems via a Gemfile.
Then we're going to take a look at the hard stuff: what Bundler is doing to your beloved ruby environment 
to fight the system (gems).  
Lastly, we'll take a look at the NP complete stuff: the resolver algorithm, which is a real-world example of 
a constraint satisfaction problem being solved with depth-first search and backtracking.
